* Journal
** Created project <2020-03-24 mar.>
- I created those notes first before any code.
- I ran the command `pesy` and a base project was created. Time to Git.
** Installed first dependency <2020-03-29 dim.> 
- I had to update Esy to latest version, it had trouble resolving the dependencies
- I installed also utop as dev dependency, running ~esy utop~ is really nice
- Piaf is really easy to use, especially module ~Piaf.Client.Oneshot~
** Created basic authentication <2020-04-13 lun.>
All of our requests will need authentication, and in Piaf there was no way to create a client that is
adding the Authorization header, so I created a functor that adds that header to all the requests.
The form might change later but the basic idea and authentication are there!

Found a better way, function creates an authenticated client fist class module.
** Simplified the authenticationlibrary <2020-04-15 mer.>
I realised I was going towards a library that was specific to Toggl with the ~`Session~ so I made the code a bit more generic.
It is only covering Basic authentication and Bearer token but so far it is enough.
** Implemented the time entry creation endpoint <2020-04-23 jeu.>
I learned how to use PPXs with pesy, it's really easy in the end.
Testing is still a bit difficult and it failed because I do not have the workspace ID,
I need to rethink in which order to implement the endpoints.
** Working with Lwt is sometimes hard to wrap your head around, but it's rewarding once it works. <2020-04-30 jeu.>
